# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: June 6, 2025**

Mojuru, developed by Alessio Ganzarolli (aka aleganza), respects your privacy. This application does **not collect, store, or process any personal data** on remote servers.

---

## 1. Authentication via AniList

Mojuru uses **AniList** as a third-party authentication provider. During login, users are redirected to AniList to authorize access.

Mojuru receives a **temporary access token**, used exclusively to interact with your AniList account.  
This allows the app to:

- Display your account content (e.g., anime/manga lists, favorites);
- **Let you modify your lists** (e.g., add, remove, or update entries) while authenticated.

No AniList data is stored by Mojuru, and all interactions occur through AniList’s official API.

See [AniList](https://anilist.co)’s Privacy Policy for more information.

## 2. Local Storage (User Settings & Plugins)

Mojuru **may store data locally on your device**, including:

- User preferences and settings;
- Custom plugins or extensions installed by the user.

This local data is **not sent anywhere**, nor accessible by the developer.

## 3. Plugins

Mojuru allows the installation of **optional, user-supplied plugins**, which may enhance or customize app functionality.

There are also **official plugins** provided with Mojuru, which are unrelated to piracy or third-party plugins.

**Disclaimer:** Mojuru is **not affiliated with any third-party plugins**, does not verify their content, and is not responsible for their behavior or effects.  
Users install third-party plugins **at their own risk**.

Mojuru **does not promote or support piracy**. Any use of plugins for infringing purposes is strictly against the intent and terms of this software.

## 4. External Links and Third-Party Content

Mojuru may display **external links**, including to websites or third-party content.  
Upon clicking such a link, the app will display a **warning message** to inform you that you are leaving the app.

Mojuru is **not affiliated** with external sites unless clearly stated, and is **not responsible** for their content or privacy practices.

## 5. Analytics and Tracking

Mojuru does **not use analytics services**, tracking SDKs, cookies, advertising libraries, or telemetry tools.  
All processing occurs **locally** on your device.

---

## 6. Security

All information obtained via AniList or through user actions (e.g., settings or plugins) remains **on your device**.  
Mojuru does not transmit or store any personal or plugin data externally.

## 7. User Rights

Since no personal data is collected or stored by Mojuru, no data access, correction, or deletion requests are applicable.

This includes, but is not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.
