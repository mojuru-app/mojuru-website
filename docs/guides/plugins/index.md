# Plugins Guide

Mojuru allows you to **bring your own content** via plugins.  
The app **does not provide ready-made plugins** and does **not develop them**, except for a few demo plugins for testing purposes.

::: warning BETA
Plugins are still in **beta**. Some fields may seem unusual, and some may be removed or modified in future updates.

## Creating a Plugin

A plugin consists of **two separate files**, both of which need to be hosted:

- [Plugin Metadata](/docs/guides/plugins/metadata/)
- [Plugin Script](/docs/guides/plugins/script/)
