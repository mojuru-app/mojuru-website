# Mojuru Plus Guide

This guide explains how to **unlock Mojuru Plus** after leaving a tip.

## Requirements

To activate Mojuru Plus, you need:

- A **tip** via our [Ko-fi page](https//www.mojuru.app/go/kofi)
- An **AniList account**

## How to unlock Mojuru Plus

1. **Make a tip** on the Ko-fi page.

   > After tipping, you should **contact the account you tipped to privately**, specifying (carefully and anonymously) the **name of your Anilist account**.

> [!IMPORTANT] IMPORTANT
> This contact must be done **exclusively via Ko-fi** to receive your Mojuru Plus key.


2. The developer will personally **activate Mojuru Plus** for your account and provide you with a **key**.

3. Open the Mojuru app and **log in with your AniList account**

   > See the [AniList login guide](/docs/guides/anilist#logging-in-with-anilist).

4. After authenticating, go to **Settings > About**, then tap the **Redeem Key** button.  
   Enter the key provided to you. Wait a moment, and Mojuru Plus will be activated, **if everything has been done correctly**.

## Important Notes

- The key is **strictly tied to your Anilist account**.
- The key will remain available and usable **as long as you do not change your account or account name**.
- If you change your account or name, the developer must **personally verify the change** before reactivating the key.
- Users should **store the key carefully** and avoid sharing it unnecessarily.
